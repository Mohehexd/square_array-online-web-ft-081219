def square_array(array)
  new_array[] << array.each
  
  #{|num| new_array.push(num**num)}
end

# new array
# use .each
#shovel or push values in new_array

# so i've gone ahead and looked at the video and realized one of the steps I need to do is push or shovel I think the new values in to the new array. But i'm not sure how to set this up along with squaring it.
